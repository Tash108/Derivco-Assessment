# Derivco-Assessment
This is my assessment.It can be launched on the command prompt with command 'npm start'.
After that lauch your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
From here you can test if the matching fucntion works as in part1 of the question.
You  now can navigate to http://localhost:3000/upload or simply click upload when you at http://localhost:3000 .
You can now upload a csv file to continue,to test if writes the results to the output.txt file.
Please note, this project does not have certain aspects.
It does not have the optional requirements.
*The results are not arranged from highest to lowest.Its is arranged in any order.
This is due lack of time because of my campus work  and no knowledege in javascript.
I have never used html language before so therefore I have used pug.
